==> What is a feature file?
#Feature file is used for creating test scenarios/test cases
#Gherkin language is used in a feature file
#All feature files must start with Feature keyword
#Each feature file can ONLY have 1 Feature keyword

************************* Scenario *************************

#  Scenario = Test Case = Test Scenario
#  Each scenario has Gherkin keyword : Given, And, When, Then, But, *
#  Given -> should be used at the beginning as preconditions
#  Then -> should be used for verification steps. Then steps are used to describe an expected outcome, or result.
#  When -> should be used in the middle steps. When steps are used to describe an event, or an action.
#  And -> should be used in the middle steps
#  I can use more than one Scenario: in a feature file

#  QUESTIONS:
#  1. Does spelling important in FF and Step defs? YES
#  2. Does order of steps in feature file matters? YES
#       YES, because tests are run top tp buttom in the future file
#  3. does order of steps definitions on step definitions folder matter? NO
#       NO, because the tests run based of the steps NOT based on the step definition

Scenario Outline : Used for DDT. Very useful.Please LEARN and USE .
Example keyword must be used
Data Tables : Used for DDT. Not as common as Scenario Outline.
We get data from any step from the feature file
Use | | pipes in feature file steps to use data tables
We can get data in different forms such as List<String, List<Map<String,List<List<String,â€¦


What are different ways to get reports in cucumber?
    With cucumber plugins in the runner class. no need to add any dependency. normally this setup is good enough
        html, json, xml
    Extent Spark reports: we use cucumber spark adamptors to get more advanced reports
        add dependencies
        add configuration files
Who to attach screenshot in the html report?
    in my framework, I have Hooks class. in @After method class I have getScreenShotAs method.
        It captures and attaches the screenshot when a test case fails
    in adition to this automatic screenshot setup, we have another methos(capture the screenshot) that I run any time to capture the screenshot.
        I use this at the end of assertions as proof of test execution



What s the differences between Data driven, keyword drivena dn hybrid framework?
    Data Driven => testing tje test cases with multiple data. In data driven testing, we sent multiple data and expect them to pass.
                    If something fails, then den fix and test with same data until all tests cases pass.
                    excel data, database data, xml data, scenario outline data
    Keyword Driven =>The above categorization can be done and maintained with the help of Excel spreadsheet:
                     Test Step: It is a very small description of the Test Step or the description of the Action going to perform on Test Object.
                     Test Object: It is the name of the Web Page object/element, like Username & Password.
                     Action: It is the name of the action, which is going to perform on any Object such as click, open browser, input etc.
                     Test Data: Data can be any value which is needed by the Object to perform any action, like Username value for Username field.
    Hybrid Framework => framework that can do both Behavior Driven Testing + Data Driven

    Normally we used excel in Junit, excel in Test NG, excel in cucumber.
    Ahmet works in Blue Car rental compony
    Framework: Cucumber BDD framework
    We mostly do BDD, but we can do TDD with cucumber using a)scenario outline b) excel
